                    AFC Construction’s expertise includes both high-end residential and multi-unit family developments. Regardless of the project’s size, every home we build is well constructed, beautifully designed, and seamlessly integrated into the natural environment.

                    Architects view AFC Construction as a partner; a firm that provides suggestions that enhance both design and constructability.
                    
                    From construction material and finishes to structural options, we take pride in finding options that will help achieve the architect’s vision, and the dreams of the homeowner.
                    
                    Our expertise also includes building homes in remote, environmentally-sensitive waterfront locations. And they frequently feature custom, detailed wood work – much of it self-performed by AFC tradesmen.

                Our light industrial construction experience includes storage facilities, warehouses and works yards. We understand the unique challenges and requirements of these types of projects, from constructing a specialized environment to working on a schedule that allows clients to occupy their building in a timely manner.

                From the beginning of every project, we look for opportunities to reduce costs, add value, accelerate timelines, enhance constructability and deliver a functional, efficient building.
